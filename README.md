the way we work is changing — no more starting from scratch on mundane tasks. with intelligent ai agents transforming our workflows, automations are taking over, and how we plan our days is getting a major upgrade.

imagine a todo app that doesn’t just track your tasks, but actually gets things done for you. **sigma** is that all-in-one workspace for notes, tasks, and projects, built for the modern era.
