The market is flooded with productivity and to-do list apps—you’ve probably tried a few yourself. But none are truly built for developers to track their tasks efficiently.

Sigma takes an AI-first approach, aiming to be more than just a task manager—it’s designed as a personal assistant and second brain for developers.

Right now, Sigma focuses on seamless task management by consolidating tasks from multiple sources like GitHub, Linear, Jira, and your calendar, bringing everything into one place to help you plan your day effectively.
