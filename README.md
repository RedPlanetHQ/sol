## About Sol

Sol connects to Slack, GitHub, Linear & Gmail — summarises PRs, drafts emails, creates issues, and clears the busywork so you stay in flow

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started is to download our [desktop app](https://github.com/RedPlanetHQ/sol/releases/tag/0.1.15) and follow the instructions in the onboarding. Create your first task and ai workflow and start managing your day better.

## ⏱ In 2 Minutes: Know What Matters Today

Sol’s Daily Sync gives you a clear, digestible summary 3 times a day—morning, afternoon, and evening. It reads your emails, Slack messages, GitHub PRs, and Linear issues to help you quickly answer:

✅ What happened yesterday? </br>
🚨 What’s urgent today? </br>
💬 Who needs a response? </br>
⚠️ What’s slipping through the cracks? </br>

## 🧩 All Your Work, One Place

No more jumping across tabs. Sol automatically collates your work items from Slack, GitHub, Gmail, Linear, and more—based on custom rules you define.

Examples of rules:

- **Linear**: Create a Sol task for every issue assigned to you
- **GitHub**: Add PRs needing your review as tasks
- **Email**: Convert Sentry/GCP alert emails into actionable tasks
- **Meetings**: Auto-create tasks from meeting summaries by tools like Fathom, Fireflies
- **Slack**: Turn customer requests or team mentions into Sol tasks

## 🧠 Personalization That Actually Matters

To help you focus only on what’s relevant, Sol uses two key components:

### 📝 Memory

A customizable knowledge base where Sol stores key facts about you:
Who you are, your responsibilities, writing preferences, module ownership, scheduling habits, and more. This makes your daily briefs feel tailor-made. You can also define what you want included in your Sync summaries.

### ⚙️ Rules

Think of rules as automation instructions that handle repetitive, manual workflows.

Examples:

- Auto-create tasks for PR comments, mentions, or tag-based triggers
- Proactive nudges when something important is slipping through
- Email response automation: “If an email comes from @sentry.com or @gcp.com and meets these criteria: [your criteria], create a task + draft a reply.”

## 🤖 Automate the Busywork

Rules in Sol don’t just create tasks—they help execute workflows end-to-end.

What you can automate:

- Highlight urgent emails in Sol chat by assigning an urgency score (1–100)
- Auto-draft personalized emails based on task context (e.g., follow-ups, updates)
- Create or update Linear issues directly from Sol
- PR Summaries auto-generated and attached to their respective Sol tasks
