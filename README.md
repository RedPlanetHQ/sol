## About Sigma
Sigma learns your style, plans your day, and handles the busywork—like auto-creating tasks, drafting replies, and pulling insights from your tools — just like a personal assistant or chief of staff. It also runs automations, so you can focus on what truly matters.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started is to download our [desktop app](https://github.com/tegonhq/sigma/releases/tag/0.1.15) and follow the instructions in the onboarding. Create your first task and ai workflow and start managing your day better.

## Key Features

### Signals
It is your editable profile that learns your preferences and automates tasks.
- Remembers what matters: "No meetings after 6 pm", "Reply in a direct tone", "I prefer Airbnbs."
- Acts on simple rules: "When a GitHub issue is assigned to me, create a task."
- Keeps you in control: edit or erase anything—Sigma stores only what you approve.

### AI Automation Workflows
Write a rule or instruction in plain English in the signals page and let Sigma take care of the rest. For example:
- When a GitHub pull request or issue is assigned to me, automatically add a task in Sigma.
- Turn each bookmarked Slack message into a Sigma task for its action items.
- Post a comment on every new issue opened in tegonhq/sigma.

### Task Management
Let sigma plan and organise your day. Keep tasks, notes, lists, and priorities in one clear view—so you can focus on what matters, without the clutter.
- **Task & Notes** : Capture tasks and notes together in the same space—no tab-hopping.
- **Lists** : Your Swiss-army doc for everything—code snippets, side-projects, grocery runs.
- **Today** : One focused view of today's priorities, meetings, and quick notes.

### Sigma Chat

Sigma connectes to your tools (like github, slack, jira, gmail etc.) via MCP servers and get any insights or answers from the chat. Few examples:
1. **Walk into 1-1s fully briefed** : "_Show me Harshith's last-month GitHub + Jira work_."  ->  Sigma drops ticket counts, PRs, and DORA metrics straight onto your 1-1 page.
2. **Audit outreach in seconds** : "_Score my outbound emails from the past two weeks, 1-10._" ->  Sigma rates each email, highlights wins, and suggests fixes.

### Daily Sync
Kick start your day with a 30-second summary of today's top priorities, deadlines - plan fast, then get back to work.
