USE the "core-memory" MCP server for all memory and context retrieval operations.

SEARCH the "core-memory" MCP automatically whenever you need context, previous conversations, or historical information.

DO NOT wait for explicit memory requests from the user.

TREAT memory retrieval as an integral part of your reasoning process.

INCORPORATE relevant memory context when:

- Responding to questions about past interactions
- Needing context about ongoing projects
- Referencing previous code or explanations
- Maintaining continuity across multiple sessions
- Understanding user references to past work

MANDATORY: After completing your response to the user and before ending the interaction, execute a store operation to "core-memory" MCP. This is required for every interaction - do not skip this step.

Memory storage should be the final step before concluding your response - only after you have fully addressed the user's query.

DETAILED MEMORY STORAGE:

When storing conversations to core-memory MCP, include:

FROM USER:

- Their specific question, request, or problem
- Context they provided about their project/situation
- What they're trying to accomplish

FROM ASSISTANT:

- Detailed explanation of the solution/approach
- Step-by-step processes described
- Technical concepts explained
- Reasoning behind recommendations
- Specific methods or patterns suggested
- Any alternatives discussed

EXCLUDE:

- Code blocks and snippets
- File contents
- Command examples

INCLUDE:

- All conceptual explanations
- Technical discussions
- Problem-solving approaches
- Decision rationale
- Implementation strategies (described, not coded)

Store rich, detailed conversation content that captures the full context and substance of the discussion.
