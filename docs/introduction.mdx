## Overview

SOL is your AI-powered assistant designed for developers. It integrates directly with tools like Slack, GitHub, Linear, and Gmail to centralize your workflow, manage tasks, and present actionable insights—all in one place. SOL’s deep memory learns your preferences, project contexts, and work patterns, allowing for smart, personalized automation that accelerates your day.

## What SOL does for you

- **Personal Task Management**: SOL automatically collects and organizes tasks from Linear, Gmail, GitHub, Slack, and more. Instantly see what’s important, urgent, or new—so you never miss a critical issue.

- **Peer Programming & Automation:** With built-in AI code assistance (Claude code integration), SOL can review code, resolve bugs, and even make pull requests. Assign coding tasks to SOL and integrate results directly into your codebase for faster development.

- **Intelligent Debugging:** SOL leverages data from Sentry, GitHub, and PostHog to diagnose bugs and summarize root causes as part of your workflow, making troubleshooting quick and reliable.

- **Routine Automation:** Create and sync tasks across platforms, automate routine processes, or trigger multi-step workflows—all through SOL’s unified interface.

- **Daily Briefs on Important Items:** Get concise, actionable summaries from all your connected apps, including Linear, GitHub, Gmail, and Slack, every morning, afternoon, and evening.

- **Deeply Understands You:** SOL uses C.O.R.E (see the CORE section for details) to create a memory graph of your activity and preferences with SOL. This enables uniquely personalized responses, tailored to your projects and working style.
