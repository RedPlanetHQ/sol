# CORE System Overview

The Context-Oriented Reasoning Engine (CORE) is SOL's fundamental system for managing, processing, and utilizing contextual information. CORE serves as the "brain" behind SOL's ability to provide personalized, relevant assistance across various workflows.

## What is CORE?

CORE is a specialized system designed to:

1. **Collect and organize context** from multiple sources
2. **Analyze relationships** between different pieces of information
3. **Apply reasoning capabilities** to derive insights and actions
4. **Maintain memory** of important facts and preferences
5. **Learn from interactions** to improve over time

## CORE Architecture

### Conceptual Layers

CORE operates through several interconnected layers:

1. **Ingestion Layer**: Captures raw data from integrations, user interactions, and system events
2. **Processing Layer**: Transforms raw data into structured information
3. **Context Layer**: Organizes information into a knowledge graph
4. **Reasoning Layer**: Applies logic and inference to derive meaning and actions
5. **Memory Layer**: Stores persistent information about users, preferences, and patterns
6. **Expression Layer**: Translates internal representations into user-facing responses

### Key Components

CORE consists of several critical components:

- **Context Manager**: Maintains the active working context for current operations
- **Knowledge Graph**: Represents entities and relationships between information
- **Memory System**: Stores long-term information about users and workflows
- **Reasoning Engine**: Applies logical operations to derive conclusions and actions
- **Pattern Recognizer**: Identifies recurring patterns in user behavior and data
- **Learning Module**: Improves system behavior based on interactions

## How CORE Works

### Context Collection

CORE continuously gathers context from:

- Direct user interactions (chat, commands, actions)
- Connected platform data (emails, messages, code, issues)
- System events and signals
- Explicit memory entries
- Previous interactions and outcomes

### Information Processing

Raw data is processed through:

1. **Entity Extraction**: Identifying key elements like people, projects, dates
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Determining how entities relate to each other
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding the meaning and intent behind text
4. **Temporal Organization**: Placing information in chronological context
5. **Priority Assessment**: Determining importance and urgency

### Reasoning Capabilities

CORE applies multiple reasoning approaches:

- **Deductive Reasoning**: Drawing logical conclusions from known facts
- **Inductive Reasoning**: Identifying patterns and making generalizations
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Forming likely explanations for observations
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Understanding sequences and cause-effect relationships
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Exploring hypothetical scenarios

### Memory Management

CORE's memory system includes:

- **Working Memory**: Temporary context for current operations
- **Short-term Memory**: Recent interactions and information
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent facts, preferences, and patterns
- **Episodic Memory**: Records of specific interactions and outcomes
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and conceptual understanding

## Integration with SOL

CORE powers various SOL capabilities:

- **Personalized Interactions**: Tailoring responses based on user preferences and history
- **Contextual Assistance**: Providing help that considers the full working context
- **Workflow Awareness**: Understanding how tasks relate to broader objectives
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Anticipating needs based on patterns and context
- **Learning Preferences**: Adapting to individual working styles over time

## CORE vs. Traditional AI Systems

CORE differs from typical AI assistants in several ways:

- **Persistent Context**: Maintains longer-term understanding beyond single conversations
- **Relationship-Aware**: Understands how different pieces of information relate
- **Workflow-Oriented**: Designed specifically for professional work contexts
- **Integration-First**: Built to work with multiple data sources and platforms
- **Memory-Augmented**: Uses structured memory to improve reasoning
