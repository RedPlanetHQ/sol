# CORE Features & Use Cases

SOL's Context-Oriented Reasoning Engine (CORE) provides a wide range of features that enable powerful workflow capabilities. This document outlines key CORE features and their practical applications in everyday professional workflows.

## Key CORE Features

### Contextual Understanding

CORE maintains awareness of various contexts:

- **User Context**: Individual preferences, responsibilities, and work patterns
- **Project Context**: Active projects, their status, and relationships
- **Team Context**: Team structure, roles, and communication patterns
- **Temporal Context**: Time-based patterns, deadlines, and historical trends
- **Domain Context**: Knowledge specific to particular fields or industries

#### Use Cases
- Providing responses that account for a user's role and responsibilities
- Recognizing when emails relate to ongoing projects
- Understanding the urgency of messages based on project deadlines
- Tailoring information based on technical expertise

### Memory Management

CORE provides sophisticated memory capabilities:

- **Explicit Memory**: Information directly stored by users
- **Implicit Memory**: Patterns and preferences learned through interactions
- **Procedural Memory**: Understanding of workflows and processes
- **Episodic Memory**: Records of specific past interactions
- **Associative Memory**: Connections between related concepts and information

#### Use Cases
- Remembering team members and their roles without repeated explanation
- Recalling previous decisions on similar issues
- Understanding user preferences for communication style
- Maintaining awareness of ongoing discussions across platforms

### Knowledge Representation

CORE organizes information into structured representations:

- **Knowledge Graph**: Network of entities and their relationships
- **Ontologies**: Formal categorization of domain concepts
- **Semantic Networks**: Meaning-based connections between information
- **Mental Models**: Representations of how systems and processes work
- **Belief Networks**: Probabilistic understanding of facts and relationships

#### Use Cases
- Mapping dependencies between projects and tasks
- Understanding organizational hierarchies
- Recognizing when different conversations relate to the same topic
- Identifying subject matter experts for specific questions

### Reasoning Capabilities

CORE applies various reasoning approaches:

- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable steps
- **Analogy-Based Reasoning**: Applying solutions from similar past situations
- **Causal Reasoning**: Understanding cause-effect relationships
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Finding solutions that meet multiple requirements
- **Counterfactual Analysis**: Exploring alternative scenarios and outcomes

#### Use Cases
- Breaking down complex project requirements into actionable tasks
- Suggesting approaches based on past successful projects
- Identifying potential bottlenecks in proposed workflows
- Evaluating different approaches to meeting deadlines

### Learning and Adaptation

CORE continuously improves through:

- **Preference Learning**: Adapting to individual work styles
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring situations and effective responses
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Adjusting based on explicit user feedback
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying knowledge from one domain to another
- **Active Learning**: Identifying knowledge gaps and seeking clarification

#### Use Cases
- Adapting communication style to match user preferences
- Learning which types of emails require immediate attention
- Improving task prioritization based on past outcomes
- Refining summary generation based on user feedback

## CORE in Action: Workflow Examples

### Development Workflow Enhancement

How CORE improves software development workflows:

1. **Code Context Awareness**
   - Understands code ownership and expertise areas
   - Recognizes patterns in code review feedback
   - Maintains awareness of architectural decisions
   - Tracks feature development across multiple PRs

2. **Release Management**
   - Correlates issues, PRs, and release timelines
   - Identifies dependencies between different workstreams
   - Predicts potential integration issues
   - Maintains context across planning, development, and testing phases

### Project Management Support

CORE capabilities for project management:

1. **Cross-Platform Context**
   - Connects conversations across Slack, email, and meetings
   - Maintains awareness of evolving project requirements
   - Tracks decision history and rationales
   - Links discussions to relevant documentation

2. **Resource Coordination**
   - Understands team member capabilities and workloads
   - Identifies potential scheduling conflicts
   - Maintains awareness of dependencies between tasks
   - Recognizes when new tasks relate to existing workstreams

### Communication Enhancement

CORE features for improved communication:

1. **Conversation Memory**
   - Maintains thread of discussions across platforms
   - Recalls previous points made on similar topics
   - Understands established terminology and abbreviations
   - Recognizes when new information contradicts previous statements

2. **Audience Awareness**
   - Adapts communication style based on recipients
   - Includes appropriate context for different stakeholders
   - Recognizes formal vs. informal communication contexts
   - Maintains awareness of sensitive or confidential topics

## Extending CORE Capabilities

SOL allows users to enhance CORE's capabilities:

### Custom Memory Entries

Add specialized knowledge directly to CORE:

```
/memory add "Team Alpha is responsible for the authentication service"
/memory add "Weekly planning meetings happen every Monday at 10 AM"
/memory add "Jane prefers detailed technical explanations in emails"
```

### Knowledge Integration

Connect external knowledge sources:

- Link documentation repositories
- Connect project wikis
- Integrate team directories
- Import domain-specific glossaries

### Feedback Mechanisms

Improve CORE through direct feedback:

- Correct misunderstandings with explicit updates
- Rate the relevance of information provided
- Indicate when context is missing or incorrect
- Specify preferences for information organization

## Best Practices for Working with CORE

To get the most from CORE's capabilities:

1. **Be Explicit About Context**: When switching topics, clearly indicate the new context
2. **Provide Feedback**: Help CORE learn by correcting misunderstandings
3. **Use Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent naming for projects, teams, etc.
4. **Leverage Memory**: Add important information to memory for future reference
5. **Specify Relevance**: Indicate which aspects of context are most important

By effectively utilizing CORE's features, you can significantly enhance your productivity and ensure SOL provides increasingly relevant and helpful assistance tailored to your specific needs and workflows.
