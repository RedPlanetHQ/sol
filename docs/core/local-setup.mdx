## Prerequisites

1. Docker
2. OpenAI API Key

## Get started

1. **Copy Environment Variables**

   Copy the example environment file to .env:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Start the Application**
   Use Docker Compose to start all required services:

   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access the App**

   Once the containers are running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

4. **Login with Magic Link**

   - Choose the "Magic Link" login option.
   - Enter your email.
   - Copy the magic link from terminal logs and open it in your browser.

5. **Create Your Private Space & Ingest Data**

   - In the dashboard, go to the ingest section.
   - Type a message, e.g., I love playing badminton, and click "Add".
   - Your memory is queued for processing; you can monitor its status in the server logs.
   - Once processing is complete, nodes will be added to your private knowledge graph and visible in the dashboard.
   - You can later choose to connect this memory to other tools or keep it private.

6. **Search Your Memory**

   Use the dashboard's search feature to query your ingested data within your private space.

## Connecting to the API

You can also interact with C.O.R.E. programmatically via its APIs.

1. **Generate an API key**

   In the dashboard, navigate to the API section and generate a new API key.

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Use your API key to authenticate requests to the following endpoints:
     - Ingest API: POST /ingest
     - Search API: POST /search
   - See below for example request bodies and details.

### Ingest API

- **Endpoint:** /ingest
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication:** Bearer token (API key)
- **Body Example:**

  ```json
  {
    "episodeBody": "I love playing badminton",
    "referenceTime": "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z",
    "source": "user", //  Which tool or user is ingesting
    "spaceId": "your-space-id", // optional, for multiple spaces
    "sessionId": "your-session-id" // optional
  }
  ```

- **Behavior:**

  - Each ingestion is queued per user for processing in their private space.
  - The system automatically creates and links graph nodes.
  - You can monitor the status in the logs or dashboard.
  - You can later connect this memory to other tools as you wish.

### Search API

- **Endpoint:** /search
- **Method:** POST
- **Authentication:** Bearer token (API key)
- **Body Example:**

  ```json
  {
    "query": "badminton",
    "spaceId": "your-space-id", // optional
    "sessionId": "your-session-id" // optional
  }
  ```

- **Behavior:**

Returns relevant text matches scoped to your private memory space.

and apps/webapp/app/routes/search.tsx.
