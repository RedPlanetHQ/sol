## Overview

Sigma Chat is your command center. Type a request and the Sigma agent can fetch data, move tasks, draft emails—whatever you need—using every tool you’ve linked.

## How it works

Sigma connects to each service through MCP servers, giving the agent live, secure access without tab-hopping or copy-paste. One chat window, one plain-language interface, real action.

## What you can do

- Task orchestration – “Auto-schedule everything due next week,” or “Create a Beta-Launch list with these five tasks.”
- Cross-app queries – “Summarise last week’s sent emails and rate my sales pitch 1-10.”
- Instant actions – “Draft a concise follow-up for PR #187,” or “Open a Jira ticket titled Fix login flare.”
- Custom endpoints – Plug in your own MCP server and talk to any internal system exactly the same way.
