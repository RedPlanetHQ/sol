## Overview

A good to-do app is a second brain, a place to unload everything racing through your head and have it resurface exactly when you need it. Sigma takes that simple promise and layers on structure, context, and automation, so ideas turn into action without the mental overhead.

Below are the building blocks that make it work.

## Tasks

Tasks are the atomic units of work—anything from “Fix login-page bug” to “Buy hiking shoes.” Each task sits in its own hub where you can:

- Open by ID – click T-42 (or any ID) to jump into its details
- Add context – notes, subtasks, attachments, links, due dates
- Track progress – mark complete, set reminders, or hand it of

### Schedule tasks in natural language

Tell Sigma when a task should happen right inside the title or notes, and it will set the date, time, or recurrence for you—no date-picker needed.

What Sigma understands:

- Relative days — “today,” “tomorrow,” “next Monday”
- Specific dates (no year) — “January 5th,” “Thursday”
- Modifiers — “this Friday,” “end of next quarter”
- Precise times — “today at 5 pm,” “tomorrow 08:30”
- Repeats — “every weekday,” “daily at 7 am,” “repeat monthly”

Example
Review marketing plan next Tuesday at 3 pm, repeat weekly → Sigma schedules it for the coming Tuesday, sets a 3 pm reminder, and marks it as a weekly recurring task—automatically.

## Lists

Lists are flexible pages that bundle every piece of context—tasks, notes, links, files—around a single theme. They keep scattered ideas from turning into siloed tasks and give each project a clear home. Work inside a List:

- Type - [ ] Do the thing to add a brand-new task (Sigma links it automatically).
- Type [[ and start searching to pull an existing task into view.
- Drop in text, screenshots, PDFs—anything you need for context.
- Use headings (#, ##) and Tab to add structure or sub-checklist.

## Daily Notes

Even with perfectly curated lists, you still need a laser-focused view of today. Daily Notes is that view:

- Auto-scheduled tasks – anything due “today” appears automatically—no hunting.
- Lightweight planning – jot morning thoughts, add quick reminders, drag tasks to reorder your day.
- One page, zero clutter – see meetings, priorities, and notes in a single glance.
