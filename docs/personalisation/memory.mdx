## Overview

To behave like a real assistant—and not just another to-do app Sigma needs context: how you work, when you like to meet, the tone you use in email, the little rules that guide your day. Memory is the single page where that context lives.

Sigma learns automatically as you interact, then writes the findings here—always transparent, always editable.

_Why it matters_

- Deep understanding Sigma recalls projects, routines, and past conversations so it can draft replies, schedule meetings, or triage tasks exactly the way you would.
- Actionable context Because the data is structured, Sigma can act on it—booking the Airbnb you prefer or blocking off post-6 pm slots without asking twice.
- Privacy & control Only what’s in Memory is stored. Edit or delete anything; nothing sticks unless you say so.

_What you might store_

- “Prefer Airbnbs over hotels.”
- “No meetings after 18:00.”
- “Founder, building Sigma—dev work is top priority.”
- “Draft emails in a direct, concise tone.”

Update it whenever your preferences shift, and Sigma instantly adapts. You stay in charge; Sigma just remembers so you don’t have to.
