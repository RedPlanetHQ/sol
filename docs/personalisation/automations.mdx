## Overview

Sigma's goal is to turn to-do lists into done lists. That only happens when the app understands your routines well enough to take work off your plate. The Automations page is where you teach Sigma those routines in plain language. Write a rule once, and Sigma carries it out every time—no code, no spreadsheets, no manual triage.

## How it works

- Open Automations from settings and write a new rule.
- Describe the trigger and the action in everyday words.
- Save. Sigma begins watching for the trigger immediately.
- Edit or delete any rule at any time—you're always in control.

## Popular recipes

### Automatic task capture

- "When a GitHub pull request is assigned to me, create a Sigma task titled Review PR &lt;number&gt; and paste the PR description into the notes."
- "If a Jira or Linear issue lands in my queue, add it to Sigma with the label Backlog."
- "Turn every Slack message I bookmark into a Sigma task."
- "Scan new meeting-summary emails; for each action item that starts with 'You need to...', create a task."

### Busy-work elimination

- "On each new issue in tegonhq/sigma, post: 'Thanks for opening this! We'll review soon.'"
- "Collect all emails containing receipts or boarding passes, file the PDFs in Reimbursements, and add an entry to my 'Expense Claims' list."

Write your own rules as naturally as you think. Sigma parses the intent, connects to your tools, and handles the drudge work—so you can focus on real progress.
