## Overview

Sync is your daily stand-up with the Sigma Agent. A few times each day, the agent sweeps your connected apps—GitHub, Slack, Gmail, Calendar, Linear, and more—then delivers one concise brief of everything that needs your attention. Think of it as a quick 1-on-1: Sigma tells you what’s waiting; you decide what happens next.

## How it works

1. Collect – Sigma watches for events you care about (new pull-requests, comments, calendar invites, etc.).

2. Condense – It bundles any untouched notifications into a single update.

3. Act – From the brief you can ask for details, mark items done, or tell Sigma to take an action—reply, schedule, assign, you name it.

## Example

You’ve set the rule “Alert me whenever a new PR is assigned for review.”

- PR #542 lands in your Inbox.
- You don’t act right away.
- In the next Sync, Sigma notes: “PR #542 needs review; Jane left a comment requesting changes.”
- Reply right there: “Sigma, leave a ‘Looks good—approved’ comment.” Done.

## Make it yours

Customize Sync’s cadence, mute noisy triggers, or add new rules so the brief feels tailor-made for your workflow. Sigma summarizes; you stay in control.
