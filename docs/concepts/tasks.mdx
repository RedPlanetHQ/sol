# Tasks: SOL's Task Management System

SOL's task system is designed to centralize and streamline your work across multiple platforms, providing a unified system for tracking, prioritizing, and completing work items.

## Task Fundamentals

### What Is a SOL Task?

A SOL task is a work item that:

- Has a clear objective
- Can be tracked to completion
- May be linked to external systems (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
- Contains context relevant to the work needed
- Can be prioritized and scheduled

### Task Sources

Tasks in SOL can be created from multiple sources:

1. **Manual Creation**: Directly created by you in SOL
2. **Automation Rules**: Generated automatically based on triggers from connected tools
3. **Conversation**: Created from chat with SOL
4. **External Import**: Pulled from connected platforms (Linear issues, GitHub PRs, etc.)

## Task Anatomy

Each task in SOL consists of:

- **Title**: Clear description of the work to be done
- **Status**: Current state (Todo, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- **Priority**: Importance level (P0-P3)
- **Due Date**: When the task should be completed
- **Source**: Origin of the task (Manual, GitHub, Linear, etc.)
- **Context**: Related information, links, and background
- **Subtasks**: Smaller steps needed to complete the main task
- **Activity**: History of actions and changes

## The Task Planner

SOL's Task Planner helps you organize and prioritize your work:

### Views

- **Today**: Tasks needing attention today
- **All Tasks**: Complete list of all your tasks
- **By Priority**: Tasks grouped by priority level
- **By Source**: Tasks grouped by originating platform
- **Custom Views**: Create your own filtered views

### Planning Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder tasks to set your working sequence
- **Time Estimates**: Add time estimates to better plan your day
- **Auto-prioritization**: SOL can suggest task priorities based on deadlines, importance, and context
- **Dependency Tracking**: Mark tasks as blocked by or blocking other tasks

## Task Workflows

SOL supports flexible task workflows to match your preferred work style:

### Basic Workflow

1. **Capture**: Create or import tasks from various sources
2. **Organize**: Set priorities, deadlines, and group related tasks
3. **Execute**: Work through tasks in priority order
4. **Complete**: Mark tasks as done when finished

### Advanced Features

- **Time Blocking**: Schedule specific times to work on tasks
- **Focus Mode**: Eliminate distractions while working on high-priority tasks
- **Recurring Tasks**: Set up regular tasks that repeat on schedules
- **Task Templates**: Create reusable templates for common task types

## Integration with Connected Tools

SOL tasks maintain bi-directional sync with connected platforms:

- Update a GitHub issue from SOL and see changes reflected in GitHub
- Complete a Linear ticket and have it automatically marked as done in SOL
- Comment on tasks in SOL and have those comments appear in the source system

## Task Intelligence

SOL's AI capabilities enhance task management by:

- Suggesting related tasks that might be impacted
- Drafting responses or actions based on task context
- Identifying potential blockers or dependencies
- Recommending optimal task sequence based on your work patterns

## Best Practices

- Review and groom your task list daily
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
- Set realistic priorities (not everything can be high priority)
- Use the notes field to capture context for future reference
