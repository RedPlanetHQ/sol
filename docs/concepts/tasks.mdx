## Overview

SOL's task system is designed to centralize and streamline your work across multiple platforms, providing a unified system for tracking, prioritizing, and completing work items.

A SOL task is a work item that:

- Has a clear objective
- Can be tracked to completion
- May be linked to external systems (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
- Contains context relevant to the work needed
- Can be prioritized and scheduled

## Task Sources

Tasks in SOL can be created from multiple sources:

1. **Manual Creation**: Directly created by you in SOL
2. **Automation Rules**: Generated automatically based on triggers from connected platforms (Linear issues, GitHub PRs, etc.)
3. **Conversation**: Created from chat with SOL

## Task Anatomy

Each task in SOL consists of:

- **Title**: Clear description of the work to be done
- **Status**: Current state (Todo, Done)
- **Scheduled Date**: When the task should be scheduled
- **Descriptions**: Related information, links, and background
- **Subtasks**: Smaller steps needed to complete the main task
- **Activity**: History of actions and changes
