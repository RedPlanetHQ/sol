# Home: Your Command Center

The SOL Home serves as your central command center, bringing together chat functionality and today's most important tasks in one convenient interface.

## Overview

The Home screen is designed to provide:

1. A conversational interface to interact with SOL
2. Quick access to your highest priority tasks for the day
3. Actionable insights about your workflow
4. A centralized hub for initiating actions across your connected tools

## Chat Interface

The chat interface is your primary method of interacting with SOL:

- **Natural Language**: Ask questions, give commands, or have conversations in plain English
- **Context-Aware**: SOL maintains conversation context for more natural interactions
- **Command System**: Use commands like `/sync`, `/task`, or `/memory` to trigger specific actions
- **Smart Responses**: Get concise, actionable responses based on your connected tools and saved context

### Key Chat Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sync` | Generate a new sync report based on current data |
| `/task` | Create a new task directly from chat |
| `/memory` | Update or query your SOL memory |
| `/help` | Display available commands and guidance |

## Today's Tasks

The Home screen displays your tasks for today, helping you:

- See what needs your immediate attention
- Track your progress throughout the day
- Reprioritize as new items come in
- Focus on what matters most

Tasks displayed here are automatically selected based on:

- Due dates
- Priority settings
- Context from connected tools
- Your work patterns and preferences

## Daily Sync

A key feature accessible from Home is the Daily Sync:

- **Morning Sync**: Reviews overnight activities and sets up your day
- **Afternoon Sync**: Provides a midday check-in on progress and new items
- **Evening Sync**: Summarizes the day and helps prepare for tomorrow

Each sync provides a concise summary of:
- Important messages and emails
- PRs and issues requiring attention
- Tasks completed and still pending
- Upcoming deadlines and meetings

## Getting the Most Out of Home

- **Start Your Day Here**: Begin each workday by checking your Home screen
- **Keep the Chat Open**: Use the chat for quick questions and commands throughout the day
- **Customize Priority Factors**: Adjust what SOL considers high-priority in your settings
- **Use Natural Language**: Ask SOL to "show me all urgent GitHub PRs" rather than navigating menus

By making the Home screen your workflow starting point, you'll have better awareness of priorities and a central place to interact with all your connected tools.
