## Overview

The Home screen is designed to provide:

1. A conversational interface to interact with SOL
2. Quick access to your scheduled tasks for the day

## Chat Interface

The chat interface is your primary method of interacting with SOL:

- **Natural Language**: Ask questions, give commands, or have conversations in plain English
- **Create tasks** Instantly create and schedule tasks simply by describing what you need in plain English
- **Context-Aware**: SOL maintains conversation context for more natural interactions
- **Smart Responses**: Get concise, actionable responses based on your connected tools and saved context

## Today's Tasks

The Home screen displays your scheduled tasks for today, helping you:

- See what needs your immediate attention
- Track your progress throughout the day
- Reprioritize as new items come in
- Focus on what matters most

## Getting the Most Out of Home

- **Start Your Day Here**: Begin each workday by checking your Home screen
- **Ask Anything**: Use the chat for quick questions and commands throughout the day
- **Use Natural Language**: Ask SOL to "show me all urgent GitHub PRs" rather than navigating menus

By making the Home screen your workflow starting point, you'll have better awareness of priorities and a central place to interact with all your connected tools.
