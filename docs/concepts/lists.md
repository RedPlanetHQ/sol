# Lists: Organization and Structure

Lists in SOL provide a flexible way to organize and group related tasks, helping you maintain structure in your workflow and collaborate more effectively.

## List Fundamentals

### What Are SOL Lists?

Lists are collections of tasks that:

- Share a common theme, project, or purpose
- Can be organized hierarchically
- May have specific properties or views
- Can be shared with team members
- Provide focused workspaces for specific contexts

### List Types

SOL supports several types of lists to accommodate different organizational needs:

1. **Project Lists**: Group tasks related to a specific project
2. **Topic Lists**: Organize tasks by subject matter or domain
3. **Personal Lists**: Private collections for individual use
4. **Team Lists**: Shared collections for collaborative work
5. **Smart Lists**: Dynamically populated based on rules and filters

## Creating and Managing Lists

### Creating a New List

To create a list:

1. Navigate to the Lists section in the sidebar
2. Click "New List"
3. Choose a list type
4. Name your list and set any properties
5. Optionally, set visibility and sharing settings

### List Properties

Customize your lists with various properties:

- **Icon**: Visual identifier for quick recognition
- **Color**: Categorize lists visually with color coding
- **Description**: Explain the list's purpose
- **Default Views**: Set preferred task viewing options
- **Automation Rules**: Attach specific rules to the list

## Organizing with Lists

Lists help bring structure to your tasks through:

### Hierarchy

- **Parent Lists**: Top-level organizational units
- **Sublists**: Nested lists for more detailed organization
- **Task Grouping**: Logical grouping of related tasks

### Filtering and Sorting

Each list can have customized:

- **Filters**: Show only tasks meeting specific criteria
- **Sorting Options**: Arrange tasks by priority, due date, etc.
- **Grouping**: Cluster tasks by status, assignee, or other properties

## List Views

Lists support multiple view options to help you work the way you prefer:

- **List View**: Traditional task list format
- **Kanban View**: Visual board with columns for task states
- **Calendar View**: Tasks arranged by date
- **Gantt View**: Timeline-based view showing dependencies

## List Sharing and Collaboration

For team environments, SOL lists offer collaboration features:

- **Shared Access**: Grant viewing or editing permissions
- **Activity Tracking**: See who changed what and when
- **Comments**: Discuss list items with team members
- **Notifications**: Stay updated on changes to shared lists

## Smart Lists

Smart Lists are dynamically generated based on criteria you define:

- **Rule-Based**: Automatically include tasks that match specific conditions
- **Query-Based**: Use search queries to define list contents
- **Time-Based**: Group tasks by timeframes (This Week, Next Month, etc.)
- **Tag-Based**: Collect tasks with specific tags or labels

### Example Smart List Rules

- All high-priority tasks due this week
- GitHub PRs awaiting your review
- Tasks related to a specific customer or project
- Items you've worked on in the last 48 hours

## List Templates

Save time by creating and using list templates:

- **Standard Project Templates**: Pre-defined task lists for common projects
- **Workflow Templates**: Lists that follow standard processes
- **Personal Templates**: Your frequently used list structures

## Best Practices for Lists

- Keep list structures relatively flat (avoid too many nested levels)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Review and archive completed or inactive lists regularly
- Combine manual organization with Smart Lists for efficiency
- Create dedicated lists for major projects or work streams

By effectively using lists in SOL, you can maintain better organization, reduce mental overhead, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
