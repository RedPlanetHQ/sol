# How Can I Use SOL Automations?

SOL's automation rules enable you to create powerful, customized workflows that handle repetitive tasks automatically. This guide explains how to use rules effectively to streamline your work.

## Understanding SOL Rules

Rules in SOL follow a simple structure:

```
When [TRIGGER] happens, if [CONDITIONS] are met, then do [ACTIONS]
```

- **Triggers**: Events that start the automation (e.g., receiving an email)
- **Conditions**: Optional criteria that must be true for the rule to run
- **Actions**: What happens when the rule executes

## Common Use Cases for Rules

### Development Workflow Automation

1. **PR Review Management**
   - **Trigger**: You're tagged for review on a GitHub PR
   - **Action**: Create a SOL task with PR details and set due date for tomorrow

2. **Issue Tracking**
   - **Trigger**: You're assigned an issue in Linear
   - **Action**: Create a task in SOL, add relevant context, tag it with project name

3. **Build Failure Alerts**
   - **Trigger**: Email received from CI system about build failure
   - **Action**: Create high-priority task, include error details, notify in Slack

### Communication Automation

4. **Customer Support Triage**
   - **Trigger**: Email from support@company.com
   - **Condition**: Contains specific customer name or project
   - **Action**: Create task, draft response, set priority based on customer tier

5. **Meeting Follow-ups**
   - **Trigger**: Calendar event ends
   - **Condition**: Meeting had specific tags or participants
   - **Action**: Create follow-up tasks for action items, draft summary email

6. **Slack Mention Tracking**
   - **Trigger**: You're mentioned in Slack in specific channels
   - **Condition**: Message contains keywords like "urgent" or "deadline"
   - **Action**: Create high-priority task with context

### Personal Productivity

7. **Morning Prep**
   - **Trigger**: Time-based (8:00 AM weekdays)
   - **Action**: Generate daily brief, create planning task, show calendar events

8. **Email Batch Processing**
   - **Trigger**: Time-based (twice daily)
   - **Action**: Summarize non-urgent emails, create tasks for ones needing response

9. **Focus Time Protection**
   - **Trigger**: Calendar event with "Focus" tag starts
   - **Action**: Set Slack to Do Not Disturb, disable notifications, log start time

## Creating Your First Rule

To create a basic rule:

1. Navigate to Automations > Rules in SOL
2. Click "New Rule"
3. Select a trigger from the dropdown (e.g., "When I receive an email")
4. Configure trigger details (e.g., from specific domains)
5. Add conditions if needed (e.g., subject contains specific words)
6. Select actions to perform (e.g., "Create a task")
7. Configure action details (e.g., task priority, due date)
8. Name your rule and save it

## Advanced Rule Features

### Multi-step Actions

Rules can perform multiple actions in sequence:

```
When PR is assigned to me:
1. Create a task
2. Draft a standard response
3. Schedule review time on calendar
4. Send Slack message to team
```

### Dynamic Content

Use variables in your rules to include context-specific information:

- `{{sender}}`: Email sender name
- `{{subject}}`: Email or message subject
- `{{body}}`: Content of the triggering message
- `{{url}}`: Link to the original item
- `{{priority}}`: Calculated priority score

### Conditional Logic

Apply more complex conditions using AND/OR logic:

```
When email received AND
  (sender contains @client.com OR subject contains "urgent") AND
  NOT subject contains "newsletter"
Then create high-priority task
```

### AI Enhancements

SOL can apply AI to your rules:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect urgent or important messages
- **Summary Generation**: Create concise summaries of long content
- **Priority Calculation**: Automatically assign priority based on content analysis
- **Response Drafting**: Generate contextually appropriate responses

## Rule Management Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic rules before creating complex workflows
2. **Use Clear Names**: Name rules descriptively for easy management
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify rules work as expected with test cases
4. **Review Regularly**: Audit your rules periodically to ensure they're still useful
5. **Organize by Category**: Group related rules together
6. **Avoid Overlaps**: Ensure rules don't conflict or create duplicate tasks

## Troubleshooting Rules

If a rule isn't working as expected:

1. Check the trigger configuration
2. Verify conditions aren't too restrictive
3. Look for syntax errors in variable usage
4. Review the rule execution logs
5. Test with simplified conditions first

By mastering SOL's automation capabilities, you can significantly reduce manual work, ensure consistent processes, and focus your attention on what matters most.
