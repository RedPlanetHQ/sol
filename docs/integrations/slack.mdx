#### Overview

Bring Sigma into Slack and turn bookmarked messages into actionable tasks—so casual pings never slip through the cracks.

#### What it does

**Bookmark** → **Task** : Star any Slack message. Sigma fetches it through Slack’s bookmarks API and (optionally) auto-creates a task with the full message text and a link back to the thread.

#### Why it helps

Ad-hoc requests land in Slack all day—“Can you review this deck?” or “Please update the roadmap slide.” Bookmark them, and Sigma captures the details, adds them to your queue, and reminds you later. Nothing gets lost in the scroll.

#### Configure

1. Navigate to Settings -> Integrations -> Slack
2. Connect your slack workspace by clicking on the Connect button.
3. Grant Permissions: Follow the on-screen prompts to grant Sigma the necessary permissions to connect with your Slack workspace.

That’s it. Add an automation rule—“Create a Sigma task for every new Slack bookmark”—and every star you drop becomes a to-do you won’t forget.
