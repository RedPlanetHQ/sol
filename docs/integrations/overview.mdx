# Integrations Overview

SOL's power comes from its ability to connect with your essential work tools, bringing information and actions together in one place. This overview explains how integrations work in SOL and what you can do with them.

## Available Integrations

SOL currently integrates with the following platforms:

### Communication Tools
- **Slack**: Monitor channels, create tasks from messages, send updates
- **Gmail**: Process emails, draft responses, create tasks from messages

### Development Tools
- **GitHub**: Track PRs, issues, and comments; create tasks from GitHub activities
- **Linear**: Sync issues, create and update tickets, link SOL tasks to Linear

### Productivity Tools
- **Google Calendar**: Sync meeting information, create tasks from events
- **Notion**: Connect documents and tasks with SOL's workflow

## How Integrations Work

SOL integrations operate on these principles:

1. **Bi-directional Sync**: Changes in either SOL or the integrated platform reflect in both places
2. **Contextual Awareness**: SOL understands the relationships between items across platforms
3. **Unified Interface**: Access content and actions from multiple tools in one place
4. **Automation Ready**: Use integrations as triggers and actions in automation rules

## Setting Up Integrations

To connect an integration:

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
2. Select the platform you want to connect
3. Authorize SOL to access your account
4. Configure sync settings and permissions
5. Set up default behaviors for the integration

Most integrations require you to authenticate via OAuth and grant specific permissions. SOL requests only the permissions necessary for the functionality you enable.

## Integration Capabilities

Each integration offers specific capabilities:

### Slack Integration
- Monitor channels and direct messages
- Create tasks from messages
- Send notifications and updates to channels
- Search message history for context

### GitHub Integration
- Track pull requests requiring your review
- Monitor issues assigned to you
- Create tasks from PRs, issues, and comments
- Get AI-generated summaries of code changes

### Linear Integration
- Sync issues with SOL tasks
- Create and update tickets from SOL
- Track issue status and updates
- Link related tasks across projects

### Gmail Integration
- Process incoming emails
- Create tasks from messages
- Draft responses with AI assistance
- Track email threads and status

## Using Integrations with Automations

Integrations become even more powerful when combined with SOL's automation capabilities:

- **Triggers**: Use events from integrated platforms to trigger workflows
- **Actions**: Perform actions in connected tools as part of automated processes
- **Conditions**: Use data from integrations to make workflow decisions
- **Enrichment**: Pull in contextual information to enhance task content

## Best Practices

To get the most from SOL integrations:

1. **Start Selective**: Begin with your most-used platforms rather than connecting everything at once
2. **Configure Thoughtfully**: Adjust sync settings to avoid notification overload
3. **Use Cross-Platform Rules**: Create automations that connect workflows across different tools
4. **Review Regularly**: Periodically check your integration settings to ensure they still match your workflow

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with integrations:

- Check that you've granted all necessary permissions
- Ensure API rate limits haven't been exceeded
- Verify that authentication tokens are still valid
- Review any specific requirements for the platform in question
