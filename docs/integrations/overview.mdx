Integrations are what turn Sigma from a smart task list into a full-service personal assistant. By linking the apps where your projects, messages, and meetings actually live, Sigma gains the context—and the permissions—to answer questions and take action for you.

#### What happens when you connect an app

- Secure authentication – You approve access with OAuth or an API key;
- MCP setup: Sigma configures an MCP server for that service, unlocking full CRUD abilities through the agent.

#### What you can do once it’s connected

- **Chat commands** : “Show my open GitHub PRs… OK, add a Looks good comment and close the stale one.”
- **Automations** : “If a Jira ticket is assigned to me, create a Sigma task and copy its description.”

#### How to add an integration

- Click your avatar (top-left).
- Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations**
- Choose the service you want, follow the steps, and you’re connected.

Connect as many tools as you like—and turn them off anytime. The more you integrate, the more powerful Sigma becomes.
