## Overview

SOL's power comes from its ability to connect with your essential work tools, bringing information and actions together in one place.

## Setting Up Integrations

To connect an integration:

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
2. Select the platform you want to connect
3. Authorize SOL to access your account
4. Configure sync settings and permissions
5. Set up default behaviors for the integration

Most integrations require you to authenticate via OAuth and grant specific permissions. SOL requests only the permissions necessary for the functionality you enable.
