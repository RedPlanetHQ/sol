# Setting Up MCP

This guide walks through the process of setting up and configuring the Model Control Plane (MCP) for use with SOL. MCP requires specific setup steps to ensure optimal performance and functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up MCP, ensure you have:

- SOL application installed and running
- API keys for the AI models you intend to use
- Administrator access to your SOL installation
- Basic understanding of AI models and their capabilities

## Installation Options

MCP can be set up in two main configurations:

### 1. Managed MCP (Recommended)

For most users, the managed MCP service provides the simplest experience:

- Fully managed by the SOL team
- Automatic updates and improvements
- Pre-configured model routing
- Usage monitoring and alerts
- Built-in fallbacks and redundancy

To use Managed MCP:

1. Navigate to Settings > AI Configuration in SOL
2. Select "Use Managed MCP"
3. Enter your organization details
4. Apply settings

### 2. Self-Hosted MCP

For organizations with specific compliance requirements or custom needs:

- Full control over data and routing
- Custom model integrations
- On-premises deployment options
- Integration with existing infrastructure

To set up Self-Hosted MCP:

1. Clone the MCP repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RedPlanetHQ/sol-mcp.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd sol-mcp
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your settings

4. Build and start the service:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

5. Connect SOL to your MCP instance:
   - In SOL, go to Settings > AI Configuration
   - Select "Use Custom MCP"
   - Enter your MCP endpoint URL
   - Save settings

## Model Configuration

### Adding Model Providers

MCP supports multiple model providers:

1. Navigate to MCP Admin > Providers
2. Click "Add Provider"
3. Select the provider type (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. Enter API credentials
5. Configure rate limits and fallback behavior
6. Save provider settings

### Configuring Models

For each model you want to use:

1. Go to MCP Admin > Models
2. Click "Add Model"
3. Select the provider
4. Choose the model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3)
5. Configure settings:
   - Context window size
   - Maximum tokens
   - Temperature defaults
   - Cost parameters
   - Specialized capabilities
6. Save model configuration

## Routing Configuration

### Basic Routing Rules

Set up how requests are routed to models:

1. Navigate to MCP Admin > Routing
2. Create routing rules based on:
   - Request type
   - Content length
   - Priority level
   - Special flags
3. Assign primary and fallback models
4. Set timeout and retry parameters
5. Save routing configuration

### Advanced Routing

For more sophisticated needs:

1. Create custom routing scripts using the MCP SDK
2. Define complex decision trees
3. Implement A/B testing for model comparison
4. Configure specialized handling for specific content types

## Security Configuration

Protect your MCP installation:

1. Configure authentication:
   - API keys
   - OAuth integration
   - Role-based access control
2. Set up request validation
3. Configure content filtering
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Enable audit logging

## Monitoring Setup

Track MCP performance:

1. Configure logging level and destinations
2. Set up performance monitoring
3. Enable cost tracking
4. Configure alerts for:
   - High latency
   - Elevated error rates
   - Excessive costs
   - Model outages

## Testing Your Setup

Before going live:

1. Run the built-in diagnostics:
   ```
   npm run mcp:test
   ```
2. Test each configured model
3. Verify fallback behavior
4. Check monitoring and logging
5. Perform load testing if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check the MCP logs for detailed error messages
- Verify API credentials are correct and not expired
- Ensure network connectivity to model providers
- Confirm routing rules are correctly configured
- Check for rate limiting or quota issues

## Next Steps

Once MCP is set up:

- Explore [MCP Usage](/mcp/usage) for practical applications
- Review performance regularly and adjust configurations
- Stay updated with the latest model capabilities
- Consider creating specialized routing for different use cases
