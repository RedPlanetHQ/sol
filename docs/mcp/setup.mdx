## MCP Configuration

If you're integrating a custom tool, you can manually register MCP servers via the config file. Here's an example using a Node.js-based server with the stdio interface:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "custom-tool": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

🛠️ SOL handles the runtime, so all you need to define is the setup. See below steps:

1. Navigate to Settings > MCP
2. Add MCP configurations manully
3. Update it
4. Start using it in SOL chat
