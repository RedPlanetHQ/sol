## Overview

Model Content Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows SOL to talk to external tools and internal data sources.

By using MCP, you can extend SOL‚Äôs capabilities‚Äîenabling it to read from your databases, trigger workflows, or pull insights from internal dashboards, all within chat.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Content Protocol) defines how tools and services provide context to large language models (LLMs) in a standardized way.

In simple terms, it lets you plug external data and APIs into SOL‚Äîsecurely and with minimal setup‚Äîso the assistant can reason over your stack and take action.

## What can you do with MCP?

- üîç Ask questions over internal tools like Notion, Jira, Confluence, or internal APIs
- ‚öôÔ∏è Trigger actions‚Äîcreate tickets, send emails, update databases
- üß† Enrich SOL‚Äôs memory with company-specific knowledge and systems

## Integration with SOL

MCP integrates deeply with other SOL components:

- **Memory System**: Leverages user memory for contextual awareness
- **Task System**: Provides AI capabilities for task analysis and generation
- **Automation Rules**: Powers AI-driven conditions and actions
- **Chat Interface**: Enables intelligent conversations with users
