# Using MCP in SOL

This guide explains how to effectively use Model Control Plane (MCP) capabilities within SOL, covering common patterns, best practices, and advanced techniques.

## Basic MCP Interactions

### Conversational Interactions

The most common way to use MCP is through SOL's chat interface:

```
User: "Summarize the last three emails from client@example.com"
SOL: [Uses MCP to retrieve emails, determine the best summarization model, 
     generate the summary, and present it in a conversational format]
```

MCP handles:
- Determining the right model for summarization
- Managing context from previous messages
- Optimizing the prompt for better results
- Formatting the response appropriately

### Task-Based Interactions

When working with tasks, MCP helps with:

```
User: "Create tasks from my meeting notes"
SOL: [Uses MCP to analyze notes, identify action items, 
     create appropriate tasks, and assign metadata]
```

MCP provides:
- Entity recognition to identify people, projects, and deadlines
- Classification to determine task types and priorities
- Structured data extraction for metadata

## Working with MCP Features

### Context Control

Control how much context MCP uses:

- **Reset Context**: Type `/reset` in chat to clear conversation history
- **Add Specific Context**: Use commands like `/context add [information]`
- **View Active Context**: Type `/context show` to see what MCP is using

### Model Selection

While MCP handles model routing automatically, you can influence selection:

- **Request Specific Model**: Use `/model [model_name]` for specific needs
- **Optimize for Speed**: Use `/fast` before requests that need quick responses
- **Optimize for Quality**: Use `/detailed` for complex or creative tasks

### Special Commands

MCP responds to special commands for specific capabilities:

- **Code Generation**: `/code [language] [description]`
- **Data Analysis**: `/analyze [data or file reference]`
- **Language Translation**: `/translate [text] to [language]`
- **Content Creation**: `/draft [content type] about [topic]`

## Developer Usage

### Custom Integrations

Developers can access MCP capabilities programmatically:

```javascript
// Example API call to MCP endpoint
const response = await sol.mcp.query({
  query: "Summarize these meeting notes",
  content: meetingTranscript,
  options: {
    maxTokens: 200,
    prioritizeAccuracy: true
  }
});
```

### Extending MCP

Add specialized capabilities with plugins:

1. Create an MCP plugin using the SDK
2. Register custom handlers for specific request types
3. Deploy the plugin to your MCP instance
4. Access new capabilities through SOL

## MCP with Automations

Combine MCP with SOL's automation capabilities:

### AI-Powered Rules

```
When email received from client@example.com
Use MCP to:
1. Analyze sentiment and urgency
2. Generate a summary of key points
3. Draft a response template
Then create a task with this context
```

### Conditional Processing

```
When PR submitted for review
Use MCP to:
1. Analyze code complexity and scope
2. If complexity > 7, assign high priority
3. Generate review checklist based on changes
4. Create targeted review tasks
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multi-Step Reasoning

For complex problems, use MCP's sequential processing:

```
User: "Plan our Q3 marketing strategy based on Q2 results"
SOL: [Uses MCP to break down into sub-tasks:
      1. Analyze Q2 data
      2. Identify trends and opportunities
      3. Generate strategic options
      4. Evaluate options
      5. Compile final recommendations]
```

### Specialized Processing

Leverage MCP's ability to route different aspects of a request to specialized models:

```
User: "Create a presentation about our new product features"
SOL: [Uses MCP to distribute work:
      - Product understanding → domain-specific model
      - Content structuring → organization model
      - Visual design suggestions → creative model
      - Technical accuracy checking → fact-checking model]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with MCP responses:

### Response Quality Issues

- Try rephrasing your request to be more specific
- Use the `/detailed` flag for more comprehensive responses
- Add more context with `/context add [details]`

### Performance Issues

- For slow responses, try `/fast` to prioritize speed
- Check your MCP dashboard for service status
- For time-sensitive tasks, specify time constraints in your request

### Error Handling

If MCP returns an error:
- Check for API quota limitations
- Verify your connection to the MCP service
- Try breaking complex requests into simpler ones
- Report persistent issues to your administrator

## Best Practices

To get the most out of MCP:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you need
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant information
3. **Use Appropriate Commands**: Leverage special commands for specific tasks
4. **Iterate**: Refine requests based on initial responses
5. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of model usage for optimization

By effectively using MCP capabilities, you can significantly enhance your productivity with SOL and leverage advanced AI capabilities in your daily workflow.
